### other open questions

— label axis? just add text anywhere in the background?
— onboarding

— more infinite canvas?
— prevent more than 3 edits to a single post? or similar edits to all post? what are the social agreements? nothing from mod side?

— coonections ???
— drag posts around (like rearrange post its?

— zoom in / zoom out (re: infinite canvas)

- undo?

should we able to see all posts at once?
should the grid be connected by noodles?
